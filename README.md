# Blocktanks Customization
Numerous advanced customizations for Blocktanks.io condensed into a single mod.  Our goal is to have it ultimately be integrated into the game.  UnknownUser and SirDrone are the primary developers of this mod.

### Customization Objectives:
1. Lets players change their tank color from the usual blue/red
   - a. In FFA, you're normally Blue and everyone else is Red.  But why can't players be green, orange, purple, possibly even black/white (depending on dark mode and ofc play-testing to verify that's okay)?   Custom colors could be allowed potentially in FFA, Battle Royale, and customs (this'd be a selectable setting for custom matches).
   - b.) For team matches, you can wear your custom colors, but everyone else will still see red/blue

2.  Lets players have preset skin loadout slots

3.  Gives players the ability to alter their own bullet skin, *visible only to themselves*, and also for customs (also a selectable setting for customs).  Think mini-gunning candy corn instead of round bullets üç¨ 

4.  More UI themes besides dark-mode

5.  Lets players change their targeting cursor (from the usual "+" shape into many other shapes, colors, and icons; this can be done for snipers as well)

Losing subscription would reset your character to the stickers, colors, cursors, bullets, etc. you had when non-subscribed.

All of the above and more could be added to the game as indeed a "Customization" or "Visual Pack" subscription, or if we feel strongly against the idea, then yes to VIP, or even as individual purchases.  VIP would still be maintained, and all the subscription stuff would be cosmetic.
